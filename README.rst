Usage
#####
Once you create ``Kokoroio`` instance, you can request from two way syncronous or asyncronous.

.. code-block:: python

   from kokoroio import Kokoroio
   client = Kokoroio(access_token='xxxxxxx')

===================
Syncronous request
===================
You will get ``requests's HttpResponse`` object.

If you want to know about response object, please refer `requests doc <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_.

-------
Example
-------
.. code-block:: python

   >>> client.channels.get().json()
   >>> client.channels.send_message(channel_id='pripara', message='getchu~')

===================
Asyncronous request
===================
Different from syncronous version, request method has ``a`` prefix like ``channels.aget()`` and you don't need to create new event loop at every request.

You will get ``aiohttp's ClientResponse`` object because using ``aiohttp`` internally.

If you want to know about ``aiohttp``, please refer `aiohttp doc <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

-------
Example
-------
.. code-block:: python

   >>> client.channels.aget()
   >>> client.channels.send_message(params={'message': 'getchu~'}, channel_id='pripara')

-------
Example
-------
.. code-block:: python

   >>> from kokoroio import Kokoroio
